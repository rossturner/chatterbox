## Technical Implementation Details

### Quantization Precision Strategy

```python
# T3 Llama Backbone - Primary target for quantization
- Transformer layers: NF4 4-bit or INT8 8-bit
- Embeddings & heads: Preserved in FP16/BF16 for quality
- Memory impact: ~2GB → 500-1000MB (50-75% reduction)

# S3Gen Vocoder - Quality-sensitive approach  
- CFM flow layers: INT8 8-bit quantization
- Mel-to-wav vocoder: Preserved in FP16 for audio quality
- Memory impact: ~800MB → 400MB (50% reduction)

# VoiceEncoder - Aggressive quantization safe
- Projection layers: NF4 4-bit or INT8 8-bit
- LSTM: Currently preserved (future enhancement)
- Memory impact: ~200MB → 50-100MB (50-75% reduction)
```

### Quality Preservation Measures

1. **Component-Specific Precision Control**
   - Critical audio generation components kept in FP16
   - Transformer weights (less sensitive) aggressively quantized
   - Embedding layers preserved for stability

2. **Conservative Defaults**
   - Default to INT8 for production use
   - NF4 available as aggressive option
   - Auto-strategy selection based on available VRAM

3. **Gradual Quantization Application**
   - Linear layers systematically replaced with quantized equivalents
   - Weight transfer with proper device management
   - Error handling and rollback capabilities

## Code Integration

### Loading Quantized Models

```python
# Simple quantized loading
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained_quantized(
    device="cuda",
    quantization_strategy="mixed"  # or "conservative", "aggressive", "auto"
)

# Check quantization status
info = model.get_quantization_info()
print(f"Quantized: {info['quantized']}, Strategy: {info['strategy']}")
```

### Memory Estimation

```python
from chatterbox.quantization_config import QuantizationMemoryEstimator

# Compare strategies
comparison = QuantizationMemoryEstimator.compare_strategies()
for strategy, estimates in comparison.items():
    print(f"{strategy}: {estimates['total']:.0f} MB")
```
